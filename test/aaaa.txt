A special meeting of the Orem City Council unanimously passed an ordinance on Friday making it illegal to target someone's home during a demonstration.

This, after protesters targeted the private home of Governor Gary Herbert following a statewide mask mandate announced last week.

The ordinance says, in part, "The public health and welfare and the good order of the community require that citizens enjoy in their homes and neighborhoods a feeling of well-being, tranquility, and privacy, and enjoy freedom from being a captive audience to unwanted speech in their homes."

Protests must be at least 100 feet away from the property line of any residence. Any violation of the ordinance is a Class B Misdemeanor.
