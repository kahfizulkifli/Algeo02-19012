FOX 13's Bob Evans knew Marcroft well and said in response to the news:

“My heart is broken at the passing of Bill Marcroft. I had the privilege of working with him during my 5 years at KUTV. He was a paragon of positivity, a loyal friend, and one of a kind. His laughter and smile are imprinted on my soul. His legendary contributions to sports in Utah, and particularly at the University of Utah, set him apart as one never to be forgotten. We love you, Billy. And will miss you dearly. Thank you for all you’ve done to lift us! God’s Speed, my friend!”

Many in the Utes athletics community and beyond also shared their condolences and expressed the impact he had.
